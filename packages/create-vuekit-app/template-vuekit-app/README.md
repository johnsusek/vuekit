Welcome to your VueKit App!

# Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

# Tips

* In Safari: Develop -> Your Computer Name -> Automatically Show Web Inspector for JSContexts
* Run Safari before your app starts
* Look at the Xcode console and Safari console for messages

With Safari running, open and run the .xcodeproj that was generated.

# Xcode Project

Some developers prefer not to add their .xcodeproj into source control, because the many small diffs caused by even minor changes can be troublesome. If you prefer this option, see the [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) [spec](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen/blob/master/Docs/ProjectSpec.md) and [usage docs](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen/blob/master/Docs/Usage.md) for how to customize your xcodeproject.json. If you instead check your .xcodeproj into source control, you may remove the xcodeproject.json file since it is only used to generate the xcode project.
