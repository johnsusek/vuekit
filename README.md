# VueKit - Technical Preview

A new way to create MacOS apps.

`npm init vuekit-app@latest`

# Dev Notes

* Suggested editor is VSCode with Volar, or any editor that supports typescript .vue SFCs. Vetur support for typescript isn't as good as Volar.

## Known Issues

* Viewing some classes in the Safari Inspector will crash the app because they send unsupported ObjC selectors to the class
